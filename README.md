Once downloaded, follow these steps:

2. Right click on the game’s application icon, then choose **Show Package Contents** from the dropdown menu.
3. In the window that opens, open **Contents** → **Resources** → **Input Devices**.
4. Drag the downloaded .plist file into the folder. You may be asked to authenticate this action using your username and password; please do so.
5. Close the Finder window and restart the game with the controller connected.
